<h1>Outreach Automation Tool</h1>


<h3>Problem:</h3>

With no email automation budget at the time, I was manually sending hundreds of emails weekly. This cost the company plenty of money in manual labor.


<h3>Solution:</h3>
I took three steps to fix the problem:

<ul>
  <li>Created email templates.</li>
  <li>Created an automation using Zapier to add new leads to a google sheet.</li>
  <li>Created a google script to automatically kick off the correct email template to email addresses in the google sheet that have not gotten an email in the last 3 weeks.</li>
</ul>

The script used to analyze the google sheet containing all my prospects and the email templates that should be kicked off based on whether the prospect has responded to my email or not, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/ajjaiyeola/Lead-Outreach-Automator/blob/Master/automator.gs">automator.gs.</a>

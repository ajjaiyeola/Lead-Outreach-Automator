<h1>Outreach Automation Tool</h1>


<h3>Problem:</h3>

With no email automation budget at the time, I was manually sending hundreds of emails weekly. This cost the company plenty of money in manual labor.


<h3>Solution:</h3>
I took three steps to fix the problem:<br>

<ol>
  <li>Created email templates.</li>
  <li>Created an automation using Zapier to add new leads to a google sheet.</li>
  <li>Created a google script to automatically kick off the correct email template to email addresses in the google sheet that have not gotten an email in the last 3 weeks.</li>
</ol>
